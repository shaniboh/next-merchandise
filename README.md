# next-merchandise
This is a repo for next-merchandise.

Overview

This project is to create and design a website for the fans and interested working partners of the boy group in china named "NEXT".
This website serves as a platform for the fans and potential fans as well as potential working partners of NEXT to know more about NEXT's history,members,albums,merhchandise and to book them for shows and concerts. This website serves to attract more fans and companies to collaborate and work with NEXT.

Design Process

During the designing the process, my motive of creating this website is to collate all the interesting facts,acheivements and events of NEXT to make the website appealing to their fans and potential working partners. Therefore, besides adding the facts that can be easily found on wikipedia or other websites, I added videos of the events that they have participated in to let users to know more than just the description of the members and their group's history. 

Therefore, in my website I added in videos of each event after the description of the individual events. 

The wireframe of the website can be seen in the link below or the attached Adobe XD files.
